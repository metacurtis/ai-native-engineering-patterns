# AI-Native Engineering Patterns

**Deterministic AI development patterns derived from the MetaCurtis Engine (15k+ particles @ 60 FPS).**

This repo documents the core architectural and workflow patterns I use to make AI-generated code **predictable**, **safe**, and **production-grade**.

These patterns are the backbone of my **AI-Native Pilot** offering.

## 🧩 Core Patterns

- **Pattern S — Single Writer Governance**  
- **Pattern D — Deterministic Directives**  
- **Pattern C — Contracts & Evidence**  
- **Pattern E — Eventguard Ordering**  

Each pattern has its own doc under [`patterns/`](patterns/).

## 🔬 Protocol: Kodex–Claude Development v3.0

Under [`protocol/`](protocol/) you’ll find the **Kodex–Claude Protocol v3.0**:

- Multi-agent AI workflow  
- Evidence-driven debugging  
- 10–15× feature velocity  
- Deterministic, repeatable development patterns

## 🌐 Why This Exists

Tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude make it easy to generate code…

…but teams are now dealing with:

- race conditions  
- regressions  
- architectural drift  
- nondeterministic behavior  
- unstable releases  

These patterns and protocols are how I stabilized a **complex WebGL engine** — and how I stabilize AI-heavy systems in client codebases.

## 💼 AI-Native Pilot

I work with teams that are:

- Using AI tools heavily in development  
- Shipping complex frontends, WebGL, real-time UIs, or dashboards  
- Struggling with instability from AI-generated code  

In a **4-week AI-Native Pilot**, I:

- Fix **one painful engineering problem**  
- Apply deterministic patterns from this repo  
- Leave the team with docs + workflows they can reuse
