# 👋 Hey, I'm Curtis

**AI-Native Engineer · WebGL & Real-Time Systems · Deterministic AI Workflows**

Most developers use AI as autocomplete.  
I use AI as a **structured, orchestrated development system** capable of shipping enterprise-grade software faster and with fewer bugs.

Over the last year, I built **MetaCurtis** — a WebGL “consciousness theater” engine — with:

- **15,000+ GPU-driven particles at 60 FPS** on integrated GPUs  
- Real-time morphing constellations & narrative stages  
- A deterministic single-writer rendering pipeline  
- Contracts, guardrails, and evidence layers around all AI-generated code  

All of it was created **solo**, using a methodology I designed for predictable, production-safe AI development.

## 🧠 What I'm Focused On

### 1. AI-Native Engineering (my specialty)

Turning AI from “code suggestion” into a **deterministic, multi-agent dev pipeline**.

I build systems where:

- Humans control architecture, contracts, event order, invariants  
- AI handles implementation *inside those boundaries*  
- Race conditions and drift are prevented at the pattern level  
- Code remains stable even when 70–90% is generated by AI  

### 2. High-Performance WebGL and Real-Time Systems

- Particle engines  
- GPU-based motion  
- Interactive rendering pipelines  
- R3F + GLSL optimization  
- Architectures that run smoothly on integrated GPUs  

### 3. The Future of Engineering Workflows

- How we shift from human-first coding → **AI-first, human-directed architecture**

## 🔬 Featured Project: MetaCurtis (Live)

**MetaCurtis** is my flagship system — both a narrative engine and a demonstration of my AI-native methodology:

- 15k particle WebGL engine  
- Stage-based morphing and “consciousness theater”  
- Adaptive quality system  
- Deterministic renderer with a strict single-writer model  
- All built with AI as my **development operating system**

## 🚀 How I Work With Engineering Teams

I run a focused **4-week AI-Native Pilot** with startups and scaling teams who:

- Use Copilot / Cursor / Claude heavily  
- Have complex frontends, WebGL, real-time, or performance-sensitive UIs  
- Are moving fast but seeing breakage, regressions, or instability  
- Want the velocity of AI coding **without** the chaos it often introduces  

### In the pilot, we:

- Pick **one painful engineering problem**  
  _(race condition, performance cliff, complex feature, renderer instability)_  
- Instrument & map the system  
- Apply my deterministic AI-native workflow  
  _(patterns, contracts, tests, guardrails)_  
- Implement a real fix in your repo  
- Leave you with reusable patterns your team can apply everywhere  

💡 Teams typically see **5–10× faster shipping** on complex issues **with fewer regressions**.

## 📚 AI-Native Engineering Patterns (Coming Soon)

I'm publishing the core methodology behind MetaCurtis:

- **Pattern S — Single Writer**  
- **Pattern D — Deterministic Directives**  
- **Pattern C — Contracts & Evidence**  
- State & event-guard layers  
- AI orchestration & guardrails  
- Workflow for turning LLMs into reliable implementers  

This repo will be public and designed to help teams adopt the same approach.
